ASAP
-add pausiable & some panic/withdraw mode
-mode for must sponsor for new markets 

MAYBE
-add a delegate call to treasury in newRental so treasury can prevent payRent being called for a user that never rented a Card
-different owner for the serious stuff

LATER
-game mode 2: creator gets a share of rent of each card
-metatransactions
-oracle token bridge etc

TESTS
-more tests on artist/creator, including returnRent mode
-check you cant call initialize more than once
