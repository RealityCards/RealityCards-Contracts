          <h2>About The Artist:</h2>
          I'm a creator at heart (and don't like writing in the third-person).
          I have created games, writing, music, code, companies and new economics. Solving the problems of the creator 
          has always been important to me. In the past I co-founded Ujo Music (which I'm currently advising),
          working with Grammy-winning artists such as Imogen Heap and RAC to launch the first music royalty projects using smart contracts. I've
          helped kickstart wholly new markets and economies. I helped to create the Ethereum ERC20 token standard 
          that's currently facilitating economies worth several billion dollars of value.
          I pioneered Curation Markets and the proliferation of the new economics around it (such as inventing token bonding curves). 
          Projects using these Curation Market ideas have raised upwards of $50m.
          I enjoy creating new forms of art and experimenting with ways to empower the creative industry.
