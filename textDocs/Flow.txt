Time collected and time acquired 

When it is foreclosed, and there is a new buyer
Time collected = now
Time acquired = now

Collect is called and no new owner required
Time collected = now
Time acquired = unchanged

When it is owned, and there is a different buyer
Time collected = now
Time held -> previous owner = collected-acquired
Time acquired = now


When it is owned, and there is the same buyer [no difference]
Time collected = now
Time held -> previous owner = collected-acquired
Time acquired = now


When it is owned, and foreclosed
Time collected = to point of deposit running out
Time held -> previous owner = collected-acquired
Time acquired = now

When it is owned, and foreclosed, and immediately bought again
Time collected = to point of deposit running out
Time held -> previous owner = collected-acquired
Time acquired = now

Time collected = now
Time acquired = now

When it is owned, then reverts to previous owner w/ collect
Time collected = to point of deposit running out
Time held -> previous owner = collected-acquired
Time acquired = now
Time collected = now


When it is owned, then reverts to previous owner, then immediately rebought
Time collected = to point of deposit running out
Time held -> previous owner = collected-acquired
Time acquired = now
Time collected = now
Time acquired = now
Time collected = now

In summary. When the token is transferred, both time collected and time held are changed to right now. 
Also when it's transferred, the time held is -> time held. 

Collected is updated every time it is ....collected


timeAcquired is currently updated upon transfer, this is right
timeLastCollected is updated whenever collection is run- either the current time or up to when it was actually paid. It is 


So there is a problem at the moment that time last collected will be in the past due to not enough deposit causing a transfer. The transfer will reset time acquired, but NOT time last collected. So at this point, time last collected is a null figure as it refers to the previous owner's collection time. But it will be updated again before transfer is called, so there should never be an issue.
